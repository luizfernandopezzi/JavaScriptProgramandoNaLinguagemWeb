# JavaScriptProgramandoNaLinguagemWeb
Personal project regarding learning and practicing JavaScript for web.

The aim of this project is to create a list of patients using JavaScript, CSS and HTML together.
You will find a default and pre defined list of five pacients at the first time that you open the index.html file.
These list contains each patient name, weight, height and body fat.
The calculus of the IMC is done by JavaScript and is not an input data of the patient.

Below the patients table, you will find a form that you can use to add new patients.
For the patients to be sucessfully added, some validation about weight and height need to be verified.
Weight must be in the range of 0 kg to 300 kg and height must be in the range of 0 to 3 m.

You can also remove pacients by double clicking at any part of the respective patient line.
An external data center (API) is used to feed the list of patients.

Finally, there is a field to search and filter by patients names.

A few tools still have to be implemented such as keep the patients even when closing/opening or refreshing the page.

The JavaScript is intended to be the most important code, thus, DOM manipulation with JavaScript was high estimulated.

Please, feel free to make your own considerations about ways of improving the code!

Best Regards,
